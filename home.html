                </h1>
                <p class="subtitle3" style="max-width: 66%;"> I have created a website listing of
                    beverage recipes. One of the key data pieces shown is the instructions for making the beverage.
                    Users can find their
                    desired drink through filtering by liquor type and ingredients, and add to cart. The aggregator in
                    the
                    cart showing the total number of ingredients could be helpful for a shopping trip, in the case that
                    the user wants to make a series of drinks that week and wants to plan ahead for the ingredients she
                    will need. The next-step
                    feature would be for the ingredients list to have specific units of each ingredient.</p>

                </h1>
                <p class="subtitle3" style="max-width: 66%;"> I wanted to go with a more simple design interface, with
                    neutral colors except for the blue of the 'my order' cart that directs viewers eyes to one of most
                    important components on the page. The overflowing grid format suggests that more drinks can be
                    discovered by scrolling. The fixed navigation bar at the top means that it can be accessed at any
                    point in the page.</p>
                <h1 class="subtitle2" style="font-weight: bold; font-style:oblique">Interface principles: is it
                    easy for users to tell what actions are possible?
                </h1>
                <p class="subtitle3" style="max-width: 66%;">I think the possiblities of actions are
                    clearly communicated with the language and labeling; the one confusing label could be the
                    'number of ingredient units' label in the cart, since the term 'units' is not extremely
                    clear. The arrows on the drop down menu are clear affordances for additional elements that
                    can be clicked.</p>
                <h1 class="subtitle2" style="font-weight: bold; font-style:oblique">Interface principles: is it
                    easy for users to tell what state the system is in and
                    perform the actions they want to perform?
                </h1>
                <p class="subtitle3" style="max-width: 66%;"> The state of the cart is clearly shown,with scrolling
                    capabilities. Buttons
                    that change color when they are hovered over provide clear feedback for users to click on them. A
                    next step would be to have a clear panel under the navigation bar that shows the 'state' of the
                    filters; for example, if its on 'rum' or 'lime' to remind users what state they are in. </p>
